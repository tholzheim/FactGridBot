# FactGridBot
A specialized Wikibase bot designed to synchronize and manage data between [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org) and [FactGrid](https://database.factgrid.de).

## Overview
FactGridBot facilitates seamless data integration between Wikidata and FactGrid by:

* Synchronizing entity mappings between the two platforms
* Adding FactGrid entity IDs to corresponding Wikidata entries
* Processing and querying data across both knowledge bases

## Key Features

* Cross-Platform Synchronization: Maintains consistency between Wikidata and FactGrid entities
* Entity ID Management: Automatically associates FactGrid identifiers with Wikidata entries
* Data Processing Pipeline: Provides robust querying and data processing capabilities
* Specialized Use Cases: Supports specific data integration tasks, such as linking family names between platforms


## Use Cases
### Entity Synchronization

* Maps corresponding entities between Wikidata and FactGrid
* Maintains bidirectional references for enhanced data tracking

### Data Processing
